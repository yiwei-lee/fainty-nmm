# Fainty's Nine Men's Morris

This is an online Nine Men's Morris game built with Google Web Tookit (GWT) and Google App Engine (GAE).

***

### What is it? ###

* Online version of the strategy board game: [**Nine Men's Morris**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Men's_Morris).
* Support playing with friends or playing with dummy AI.
* Players' as well as matches' information is stored in database.
* Player can resume a match anytime he/she wants.

### What does it include? ###

* A full stack game built upon GWT and GAE and can be deployed easily.
* Basic sound effects and animations.
* A bunch of unit tests of functions as well as game logics.

### Why GWT/GAE? ###

* GWT enables user to create web apps in Java, and compiles it into JavaScript.
* Well integrated with Eclipse and modern web browsers, enabling easy testing and debugging.

### What is it missing? ###

* A better AI that could actually beats human players (I was trying to implement one with search and alpha-beta pruning but did not finish it due to time constrain).
* Two years later this solution for a web app (GWT+Java) seems cumbersome. A neat JavaScript + Python (or Node.js) version should be enough.

### Where this project is currently hosted ###

* Currently this project is hosted on Google App Engine (the repository used to be on Google Code before Google shut it down).

### Link to my other code ###

* While this code demonstrates my interest in web app (and it was built two years ago, when I was not fully aware of the importance of **documentations** and **comments**), my efforts as software engineer to produce high quality, maintainable code can also be reviewed at:

1. A simplified distributed database, complete with multiversion concurrency control, deadlock avoidance, replication, and failure recovery. Link: https://bitbucket.org/databaser/repcrec
